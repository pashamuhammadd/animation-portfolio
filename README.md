# Animation Portfolio

I have collaborated with several Web3 projects, including **BabyAndy**, **ApeMan**, **POPCAT**, **MoonTrump**, **NeiRei**, **Lemmi**, and more.  
My workflow includes two primary animation techniques: **Frame-by-Frame** and **Rigging**, each selected to bring out the best visual impact for every project.
